# Vélo-cité by [Tigris Li](http://tigris.li)
Vélo-cité is a project that analyzes the very manner in which people navigate space.In the simplest of terms, biometric data is collected using a bicycle, whereby the speed people pedal is then processed through an algorithm to generate a psychogeographic map that reflects an individual’s rate of motion.

The objective is to emphasize the unique nature of one’s interaction with one’s environment: we can navigate identical spaces and yet come to understand them in entirely different ways.
